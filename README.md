# My Happiness

My Happiness is a Google Chrome extension designed to measure your happiness throughout the year. It is a tool for you to reflect how often you were happy or sad for the past year.

# Installation


# How to use

All that is required are 2 button clicks.

The user can record their happiness by selecting one of the five emojis - 😭, 😢, 😐, 😊 & 😁 (from very sad to very happy).
Once selected, the user can save their happiness by clicking "Save". 
They also have the option to write a short memo on what happened that day that made them feel the way they chose. Only a maximum of 100 characters is allowed though (about 30-40 words).

The user has one whole day to record their happiness for that day. The user can change their happiness during the day if they want to. However, once the day is over, they cannot go back to change it anymore. 
This is a reminder that you cannot change the past! Let's make the future better!

If the user forgot to measure their happiness for the day, this thinking emoji "🤔" will be inserted for that day. What does this mean? Check out your happiness history.

You can reflect on how happy or sad you have been for the past days & months. 
There is a link at the top of the pop-up that says "Happiness History". Click that to see your happiness all the way from the beginning of the year till today!

You will find a summary of how many days you have been happy, sad or too busy (or too lazy) that you forgot to measure your happiness. Hover over the emoji to read the comment you added for that day.
